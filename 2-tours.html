      <p>"Whether you’re a longtime resident, a first time visitor or anything in between—Austin Pedicab Company tours are an amazing way to experience one of America’s most unique cities. Pedicab tours combine the intimacy and relaxed pace of a self-guided walking tour with the comfort and informative commentary of the classic vehicular guided tour—and no one does it better than Austin Pedicab Company’s personable and knowledgeable drivers.</p> 
      
      <P>My driver knew all the right spots for food and drink. Whatever your passion: architecture, barbeque, microbrews, history, music … or anything else Austin Pedicab Company either has the tour you want or will design it for you."</p>
